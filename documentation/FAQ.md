# FAQ

## I bought Flipper Zero, and I don't know what I can do with it, please help!

- Start with reading [official main page](https://flipperzero.one/)
- Then check out official docs where you can find answers to [most questions](https://docs.flipper.net/)

## How do I install Unleashed Firmware?

See [this](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/HowToInstall.md)

## What version should I install? What do the letters `e`, `r`, `c`... mean?

Follow this link for [details](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md#recommended-update-option---web-updater).

## I installed Unleashed and now the backlight doesn't work

You’ve installed a version made for custom RGB modded flippers. The version ending in `r` is specifically for `RGB` modded flippers. <br />

Please, do not use that version if your flipper isn’t modded!
  
## What apps (plugins) are included with Unleashed Firmware?

See default pack and extra pack (for `e` build) list [here](https://github.com/xMasterX/all-the-plugins/tree/dev).

## Where can I find differences between the original (official) firmware and Unleashed Firmware?

[Right here](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#whats-changed)

## How to use the SubGHz Remote app?

1. Open the app, press the `Back` button, and select `New map file`
2. Configure signal files and their names for every button (also you can only add one signal and make other buttons empty - just don't select any files for them in config)
3. Save the new map file
4. Open the map file and select your previously created file
5. Use buttons to send the subghz signal files that you selected in map config at step 2

## How to build (compile) the firmware?

Follow this [link](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/HowToBuild.md#how-to-build-by-yourself).

## I installed Unleashed firmware, and now my mobile app doesn't connect to flipper ( OR I changed flipper device name, and my mobile app now doesn't connect to flipper )

  1. Click Forget flipper in the mobile app
  2. Open `Phone Settings - Bluetooth`, find the flipper - if it present here - open its options and click forget device
  3. On the flipper itself open `Settings -> Bluetooth -> Forget all devices` and confirm
  4. Make sure your flipper has bluetooth `ON` then open the mobile app and pair it to the flipper

## My desktop (pin, favourites, etc..) (or other) settings were reset to default after an update, what do I do?

Just configure those settings again, and make sure you view the changelogs for the releases that came out after your previous version, when settings struct is changed, the settings file is reset after an update, this happens only when struct changes are required, so don't assume that settings will be reset in every release, this will only happen in specific ones

## Why is my flipper not connecting to Chrome?

The most common cause of the flipper not connecting to google chrome is having qFlipper open while trying to connect your flipper. <br />

Or having second flipper lab page open at same time.<br />

You must close qFlipper (or other flipper lab web pages) before attempting to connect your flipper to Chrome.

## How can I support the Unleashed firmware project?

Please follow this [link](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware#please-support-development-of-the-project).

## What are the dev builds? Where I can get the latest build for dev branch?

This is an automatic assembly of the latest commits from this repository that have not yet been released. The previous build is deleted when a new one is uploaded, and the old one remains only as a file in the telegram channel

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Be wary - these are not release ready builds!
>
> They may have bugs and issues!
> If you are using the dev build and find issues:
> Report it! [GitHub issues](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/issues)

Dev builds are available in Discord, in channel - `unleashed-development` <br />
Builds can also be found [here](https://t.me/kotnehleb).<br />
And [here](https://dev.unleashedflip.com/)<br />

## What is the update server?

We have our own update server https://up.unleashedflip.com/directory.json  <br /><br />
It is identical to the official one; it is impossible to change it in applications without rebuilding the application <br /><br />
If you want to use it, you need to patch or build your own build of the application you are interested in <br />

Also you can use it with uFBT to build apps for UL SDK - uFBT will accept that link as one of args<br />

The server will remain active and will be automatically updated

## External Radio: How to connect the CC1101 module

[Guide](https://github.com/quen0n/flipperzero-ext-cc1101)

## How to add extra Sub-GHz frequencies

[Guide](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/SubGHzSettings.md)

## How to use Flipper as new remote (Nice FlorS, BFT Mitto, Somfy Telis, Aprimatic, AN-Motors, etc..)

[Guide](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/SubGHzRemoteProg.md)

## How Can I Unlock / Remove SubGHz restriction?

> [!TIP]
>
> If you are using Unleashed Firmware - **all region locks are removed by default**!

Also, there is a way to go outside of frequencies stated in `CC1101 datasheet`, but transmission on those frequencies may cause chip damage, make sure you know what you are doing! 

Do not edit these settings to bypass region lock since there is no region locks in unleashed, all chip supported frequencies will work without any extra steps.<br /><br />

But, if you know that you need to bypass subghz chip safety restrictions - you can unlock the safety restriction which will allow you to go outside the chips supported frequency. <br /><br />
This covers how to do it and information regarding the risks of damage to the flipper by doing so. 

Please read [this](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/DangerousSettings.md) before.

## Can I clone a car key fob for my own car to use my flipper as a key?

No, and trying to do so with Read RAW will lead to key desync or unpair with blacklist which means re-pair is very hard to do and requires service tools

## Will Unleashed Firmware support car keyfobs decoding, cloning, emulating?

No, never!

## Where can I find jamming files?

Nowhere, this is illegal in almost every country in the world!

## I saw something on TikTok and want to ask how to do it. I just wanna be like real hacker!

You might be banned for that in our communities since 99% of that content is fake or illegal. We do NOT like TikTok questions.

## I was banned from the Unleashed Discord / Telegram / etc.. How do I get unbanned? I created a GitHub issue, and it was removed too!

Not possible, rules are rules, read them before sending messages in our communities

## How to clean .DS_Store and other dot files left from macOS

`sudo dot_clean -mn /Volumes/Flipper\ SD` -> `Flipper\ SD` may be named differently for you, replace it with your microSD card name

## How to sort files on flipper microSD on macOS / Linux?

Will make sorting faster, and will work for OFW:
1. `brew install fatsort` -> Install fatsort using `brew.sh` (only on macOS)
2. `diskutil list` -> Find your disk name for flipper microSD
3. `diskutil unmount /Volumes/Flipper\ SD`
4. `sudo fatsort -n /dev/disk4s1` -> Replace `disk4s1` with your microSD id found on step 2

## My flipper feels slow and unresponsive?

1. Make sure you are using a good microSD card from a known brand. Flipper works with microSD via SPI meaning not all microSDs will work well even if they are compatible with other devices.
2. Go into `Settings -> System` and make sure that you have
    ```text
    Log Level = None
    Debug = OFF
    Heap Trace = None
    ```
3. If some settings are set to something different - change them to `None` / `OFF` 
4. Make sure your battery is charged, that can affect performance too

## Flipper crashed, stuck, frozen?

Reboot it by holding `Left` + `Back` buttons

![how to reboot flipper gif, shows how to hold left and back button](https://media.tenor.com/eUbBDDEzmwMAAAAC/flipper-zero-flipper-zero-reboot.gif)

## How to reset a forgotten Flipper pin code?

**Disconnect USB Cable if it was connected**
1. Turn off the device - hold back button -> `Turn Off` 
**If you can't turn it off, try the next step but hold the buttons for 30-40 seconds)**
2. Hold <kbd>Up</kbd> + <kbd>Back</kbd> for `~5 sec` -> You will see a reset screen -> Hold <kbd>Right</kbd> to reset (and <kbd>Down</kbd> arrow to exit if you don't want to reset your pin code)
3. Done, internal memory (dolphin level, settings, pin code) is erased to default settings

## What are the differences between x, y, and z firmware?

If you just got your flipper and not sure what will work better for you, start with original official firmware, if you think you need more features or want to remove subghz region locks then:<br />
* Try installing **Unleashed firmware**, which is fork of official firmware with many new features and preinstalled plugins (check out `e` build).<br />
* In other case, If you want to experiment more with UI and other things look for existing forks of Unleashed Firmware.<br />
* Or, create your own fork with your own customisations<br />
* Also, before reporting any found issues, make sure you are in correct repo, if you are not using **Unleashed**, but a different fork or the original firmware, do not report issue in **Unleashed firmware** repo or UL communities (Telegram, Discord, etc..)

## Is there a correct way to capture Infrared signals?

There is indeed, especially with AC units - a new documentation has been released with some notes and steps on capturing infrared signals correctly along with some example data so you visually able to understand the difference between the two.

[More info](https://github.com/DarkFlippers/unleashed-firmware/blob/dev/documentation/InfraredCaptures.md)

## NFC / RFID FAQ

From our good friends `@Equip` and  `@np0` <br />

### MIFARE Ultralight

Scan the card, hold the Flipper Zero up to the reader to get the password to unlock the rest of the sectors, then scan the card again.

### MIFARE DESFire / MIFARE Ultralight C

The Flipper Zero has no available attacks for this card currently.
 
### Bank cards

- You cannot clone bank cards
- The Flipper Zero cannot emulate bank cards
- The Flipper Zero cannot pretend to be a point of sale machine
 
### Amiibos

- `NTAG215`. That's it. It's not going on a MIFARE Classic. 
- Currently, you cannot write Amiibos to new physical tags.
 
### HID / iClass

- `Picopass` iClass can be read using the `Picopass` reader plugin
- 26bit Picopass can be downgraded to H10301 RFID credentials (note, it is not guaranteed to work if the reader is not configured to read low frequency)
- Readers will need to be configured and have an LF RFID antenna in order to be read. Certain iClass readers are HF only, and do not have the ability to have LF configured.
- **Emulation for Picopass** was added on July 26th, and the updated version can be found in latest releases of **Unleashed** Firmware with apps preinstalled, or in official Apps Hub via Flipper Mobile app
- Write support for personalization mode cards is doable with the app
- The Seader app and a [SAM expansion board](https://www.redteamtools.com/nard-sam-expansion-board-for-flipper-zero-with-hid-seos-iclass-sam/) will allow you to read more secure HID cards, which may be helpful in downgrade attacks
 
### LF-RFID

If you want to make clones of low frequency RFID chips you need to write to T5577's. `Blanks` do not exist. All of the chips the Flipper Zero can interact with are read-only and cannot be overwritten or purchased blank. 

T5577s are multi-emulator chips that the Flipper Zero can program to be other tags
 
### Unknown Card / Fob

If you have exhausted all options of scanning via NFC / RFID / PICOPASS then take a photo of:

- The front and back of your credential 
- The reader you use with the credential 
- If your credential is a card, hold it up to a very bright light source e.g. a lightbulb and take a photo of the exposed antenna. This is useful for identification, post it for us to identify!
